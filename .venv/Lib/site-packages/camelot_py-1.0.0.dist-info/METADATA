# Camelot: PDF Table Extraction for Humans

**Camelot** is a Python library that can help you extract tables from PDFs.

---

**Extract tables from PDFs in just a few lines of code:**

Try it yourself in our interactive quickstart notebook. [![image](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/camelot-dev/camelot/blob/master/examples/pypdf_table_extraction_quick_start_notebook.ipynb)

Or check out a simple example using [this pdf](https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot/blob/main/docs/_static/pdf/foo.pdf).

<pre>
>>> import camelot
>>> tables = camelot.read_pdf('foo.pdf')
>>> tables
&lt;TableList n=1&gt;
>>> tables.export('foo.csv', f='csv', compress=True) # json, excel, html, markdown, sqlite
>>> tables[0]
&lt;Table shape=(7, 7)&gt;
>>> tables[0].parsing_report
{
    'accuracy': 99.02,
    'whitespace': 12.24,
    'order': 1,
    'page': 1
}
>>> tables[0].to_csv('foo.csv') # to_json, to_excel, to_html, to_markdown, to_sqlite
>>> tables[0].df # get a pandas DataFrame!
</pre>

Camelot also comes packaged with a [command-line interface](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/cli.html)!

Refer to the [QuickStart Guide](https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot/blob/main/docs/user/quickstart.rst#quickstart) to quickly get started with Camelot, extract tables from PDFs and explore some basic options.

**Tip:** Visit the `parser-comparison-notebook` to get an overview of all the packed parsers and their features. [![image](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/camelot-dev/camelot/blob/master/examples/parser-comparison-notebook.ipynb)

**Note:** Camelot only works with text-based PDFs and not scanned documents. (As Tabula [explains](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula#why-tabula), "If you can click and drag to select text in your table in a PDF viewer, then your PDF is text-based".)

You can check out some frequently asked questions [here](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/faq.html).

## Why Camelot?

- **Configurability**: Camelot gives you control over the table extraction process with [tweakable settings](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced.html).
- **Metrics**: You can discard bad tables based on metrics like accuracy and whitespace, without having to manually look at each table.
- **Output**: Each table is extracted into a **pandas DataFrame**, which seamlessly integrates into [ETL and data analysis workflows](https://gist.github.com/vinayak-mehta/e5949f7c2410a0e12f25d3682dc9e873). You can also export tables to multiple formats, which include CSV, JSON, Excel, HTML, Markdown, and Sqlite.

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge camelot-py
```

### Using pip

After [installing the dependencies](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/install-deps.html) ([tk](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/python/python-tk) and [ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/)), you can also just use pip to install Camelot:

```bash
pip install "camelot-py[base]"
```
